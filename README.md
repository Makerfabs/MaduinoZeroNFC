Maduino Zero NFC is an Arduino-compatible small development board with NFC (Near-Field Communication).

This board will be the bridge that helps you wirelessly interact with your environment, drive motors, unlock strikes, control relays, read from a temperature sensor, and all thanks to built-in NFC connectivity, right out of the box. Same as other Maduino Zero boards, this board is based on ATSAMD21G18(which actually makes it available to work with MicroPython, if you re-program the bootloader).

- Arduino compatible
- ATSAMD21G18, 32-Bit ARM Cortex M0+
- Size: 40*55mm
